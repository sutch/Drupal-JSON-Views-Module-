Drupal JSON Views Module
========================

What's This?
------------
This is a views backend module for supporting json from source.
Cause i dont have dev access to drupal repos, and has no time to idenfity it, i push it to github.
Everyone could change it and move it to drupal repos whatever. I copied a lot of code from views_xml_backend.

This project is one time code project. 
(That means i will finish a trial version, and leave it alone. You could certainly continue it by your choice.)

How To Use?
---------------
Just install it as normal module.
